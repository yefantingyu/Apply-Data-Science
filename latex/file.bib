abstract = {Geodesign couples design processes with dynamic geospatial digital technologies to advance solutions to intractable land-use design and planning challenges. Geodesign extends the analytical role of traditional GIS into a process that reveals creative change solutions for a place. To make sense of myriad systems and data now available, the geodesign approach provides a way to organize and prioritize, resulting in unprecedented insights to shape sustainable design choices. People are in the position to accept or reject the outcomes and recommendations for landscape change, so human interaction and collaboration play a central role in the geodesign process. With a goal to devise solutions relevant to the place and the community's values, geodesign places a greater emphasis on how decisions are made, instead of allowing data to be the driver. The process is rooted in a series of fundamental questions that assist stakeholders in articulating what is desired and sustainable for the future. Impacts of proposed changes are visualized on graphical interfaces and dashboard metrics, allowing stakeholders to see which different design choices succeed in meeting desired outcomes. Geodesign is providing societal affordances in planning and design for scales ranging from resilient urban design to conservation planning.}

    abstract = { The goal of this article is two-fold: to introduce the concept of augmented deliberation and to demonstrate its implementation in a pilot project.We look specifically at a project called Hub2. This community engagement project employed the online virtual world Second Life to augment community deliberation in the planning of a neighborhood park in Boston, Massachusetts. The local community was invited to gather in a physical space and a virtual space simultaneously, and a physical moderator and virtual designer orchestrated deliberation.This project demonstrates the design values central to augmented deliberation: (1) it is a multimedia group communication process which balances the specific affordances of digital technologies with the established qualities of face-to-face group deliberation; (2) it emphasizes the power of experience; and (3) it promotes sustainability and reproducibility through digital tracking. Augmented deliberation, when properly designed, provides a powerful mechanism to enable productive and meaningful public deliberation. The article concludes with directions for further research. }

abstract = {Transportation systems are complex sociotechnical systems and this dual nature is reflected in the literature dealing with their planning, i.e. defining courses of action from both public and private points of view. On the one hand, the social sciences literature makes it clear that most decisions related to transportation are “wicked”, i.e. they cannot be tackled with traditional engineering approaches since they are poorly defined. On the other, transportation systems have a strong technical component affecting most of such decisions, as they have to (or should) comply with compelling technical and economic requirements. The literature on transport engineering and economics deals with transportation planning mostly as a rational process based on the formulation and comparison of alternative options. In this paper, we propose an approach to planning and designing transportation systems, at least in the more complex cases, meant to bridge the gap between social and technical points of view. The proposed approach is cross-disciplinary, as it integrates notions from cognitive sciences, organization and management sciences with transportation systems analysis. Transportation planning, both under public and private market-oriented viewpoints, is seen as a complex decision-making process where different actors (decision-makers, stakeholders, professionals) interact in different contexts and according to different “models” or approaches. After a brief discussion of the main elements of most planning processes and of the different decision making models, the paper proposes a decision-making model based on three parallel and intertwined processes: a cognitive rational approach to organizing the decision-making process, a five-level stakeholder engagement process, and a revised role of quantitative analyses and methods drawing on tools from engineering and economics, amongst other disciplines. We also present a real application of the proposed decision-making model to the case study of the Regional Metro System (RMS) project in Campania (southern Italy), where a complex decisional context with different stakeholders and multiple (often contrasting) interests was managed in the integrated framework for over a decade, resulting in the largest and most effective of such projects in Italy. Finally, the paper proposes new roles and new challenges for quantitative analyses and mathematical tools to support participated decision-making processes, extending their well-established functions for designing and assessing transportation solutions.}

abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) has shown potential as a promising tool to exploit under-utilized urban data sources. This paper presents a systematic review of urban studies published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings that adopted NLP. The review suggests that the application of NLP in studying cities is still in its infancy. Current applications fell into five areas: urban governance and management, public health, land use and functional zones, mobility, and urban design. NLP demonstrates the advantages of improving the usability of urban big data sources, expanding study scales, and reducing research costs. On the other hand, to take advantage of NLP, urban researchers face challenges of raising good research questions, overcoming data incompleteness, inaccessibility, and non-representativeness, immature NLP techniques, and computational skill requirements. This review is among the first efforts intended to provide an overview of existing applications and challenges for advancing urban research through the adoption of NLP.}
