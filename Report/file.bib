abstract = {Geodesign couples design processes with dynamic geospatial digital technologies to advance solutions to intractable land-use design and planning challenges. Geodesign extends the analytical role of traditional GIS into a process that reveals creative change solutions for a place. To make sense of myriad systems and data now available, the geodesign approach provides a way to organize and prioritize, resulting in unprecedented insights to shape sustainable design choices. People are in the position to accept or reject the outcomes and recommendations for landscape change, so human interaction and collaboration play a central role in the geodesign process. With a goal to devise solutions relevant to the place and the community's values, geodesign places a greater emphasis on how decisions are made, instead of allowing data to be the driver. The process is rooted in a series of fundamental questions that assist stakeholders in articulating what is desired and sustainable for the future. Impacts of proposed changes are visualized on graphical interfaces and dashboard metrics, allowing stakeholders to see which different design choices succeed in meeting desired outcomes. Geodesign is providing societal affordances in planning and design for scales ranging from resilient urban design to conservation planning.}

abstract = {Based on an idealized model with six distinguishing criteria of geodesign projects -- large areas, complex issues, and multi-person teams; digital computing, algorithmic processes, and communications technologies; collaborative, information-based projects; timely feedback about impacts and implications of proposals; dynamic modeling and simulation; and systems thinking -- the technological supports required for each of these criteria are described.}
